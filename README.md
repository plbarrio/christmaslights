### Bill Of Materials (BOM)

- [Arduino nano](https://aliexpress.com/item/32531372300.html). I ordered one with pins unsoldered since I soldered directly on the board. 
- [WS2811 50 led strip](https://aliexpress.com/item/32444134206.html). There are also with [green cables](https://aliexpress.com/item/32444382333.htm) that are more discrete. 
- [Switch](https://aliexpress.com/item/32964605422.html). One with a long button is better.
