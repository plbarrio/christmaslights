## Hardware

It uses an arduino nano, WS2811 led strip and a button for change the different modes.

### Bill Of Materials (BOM)

- [Arduino nano](https://aliexpress.com/item/32531372300.html). I ordered one with pins unsoldered since I soldered directly on the board. 
- [WS2811 50 led strip](https://aliexpress.com/item/32444134206.html). There are also with [green cables](https://aliexpress.com/item/32444382333.htm) that are more discrete. 
- [Switch](https://aliexpress.com/item/32964605422.html). One with a long button is better. 
- USB charger. A used one from a cellular phone.  
- USB Cable type A male <-> type mini-B male. Reused from an old camera.  
- Plastic box. Reused a candy one.  
- A cable tie.  
- Three-wire cable.  
- Soldering tin.  
- Glue for the glue gun.
- Insulating tape
- Heat shrink tube
